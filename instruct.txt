********This will only work in Cinema 4D R12+*********

This file consists of a polygon object to which a Python tag (a) is applied. This Python tag imports per each frame, a txt file
(fileName-#frame.txt) with a list of N points in the format x, y, z which builds the point cloud of the imported object.
The Python also updates a point selection tag (g) consisting of all points which are  not (0, 0, 0). This tag is applied to the Cloner 
Object and prevents it from cloning a gazillion unnecessary objects in origin.

a) Python script
b) skip every n points in the imported data. Equals less resolution
c) Drop the name of the sequence you are importing from the processing script (described elsewhere) here. If no path is present, the script won't work. duh.
d) Nummber of files of the sequence
e) 100% means normal playspeed. Less means, well, slower.
f) The polygon object which will be reconstructed from the imported kinect data. If you are starting from a fresh file, create a empty polygon object and drag it here.


Have fun!
